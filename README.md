**Architecture**
This project involved developing a full stack web application for Travlr Getaways, utilizing the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) to create a comprehensive travel booking system. The frontend development included Express HTML and JavaScript for static and dynamic pages, complemented by an Angular-based single-page application (SPA) for a seamless user experience. The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database for its flexibility and scalability, efficiently managing diverse data types such as user information and travel packages. JSON facilitated smooth data exchange between the frontend and backend. Extensive API testing ensured robust request and retrieval methods, while security measures like token-based authentication safeguarded endpoints. This project not only reinforced my skills in web development but also emphasized the importance of ethical considerations and best practices in creating secure, efficient, and user-friendly applications.

**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**
The backend of the project utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility and scalability, which are essential for handling varied and dynamic data structures typical in a travel booking system. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB's document-oriented storage allows for more natural data representation and easier integration with JSON data formats. This choice facilitated the storage of diverse data types such as user information, travel packages, and booking details, enabling efficient querying and manipulation of nested documents. Moreover, MongoDB's scalability and performance in handling large volumes of data made it an ideal choice for the backend, ensuring that the application could effectively manage growing datasets and provide fast access to information.

**Functionality**
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is distinct from JavaScript, though inspired by its syntax. JSON is used to structure data in a way that is both easy to read and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for machines. In the context of full stack development, JSON acts as a bridge between the frontend and backend, allowing data to be exchanged seamlessly. For instance, when a user inputs data on the frontend, it is often sent to the backend in JSON format, where it can be processed and stored in the database. Throughout the project, I refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency, such as modularizing reusable UI components. This approach not only enhanced code maintainability but also facilitated quicker development and consistency across the application by allowing components to be reused in multiple places, reducing redundancy and errors.

**Testing**
In a full stack application, understanding methods, endpoints, and security is crucial for ensuring reliable and secure data interactions. Methods like GET, POST, and DELETE are used to retrieve, create, and delete data, respectively. Endpoints are specific URLs where these methods are applied to interact with the backend services. Ensuring these endpoints function correctly requires thorough API testing, particularly when adding layers of security such as authentication and authorization. I used Postman extensively for testing and debugging in my full stack project. By running GET requests, I verified data retrieval, while POST requests were used to create new entries in the database, and DELETE requests ensured proper data removal. This testing process helped identify and fix issues, ensuring that the endpoints performed as expected while maintaining the security and integrity of the application.

**Reflection**
This project provided valuable hands-on experience in full stack development, reinforcing key concepts in web application architecture, backend services, dynamic frontend interfaces, and security measures. The skills gained from this project have enhanced my proficiency as a software developer, making me a more marketable candidate in the tech industry. The focus on ethical responsibilities and best practices ensured the development of a functional, efficient, secure, and fair application, aligning with industry standards and expectations.
